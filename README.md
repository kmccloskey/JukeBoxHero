## (Ambient) JukeBox Hero

[Live demo](https://kmccloskey.github.io/JukeBoxHero)

This ambient jukebox, inspired by the noise-generator [Noisli](http://www.noisli.com), provides a simple interface for generating ambient noise from natural and synthetic sounds: gentle rain, wind, crackling fire, synth tones, soft chatter, and thunderstorms. The right blend of ambient noise can often minimize distractions and enhance concentration. Here's how it works:

* Click a large icon to activate a sound
* Change volume with the controls under each icon to fine tune each sound
* Audio buttons at the bottom of the screen will control all sounds:
    * _Play_ will activate all sounds 
    * _Pause_ will pause all sounds
    * _Stop_ will stop and restart all sounds
    * _Randomize_ will create a random mix (Try it a few times!)
